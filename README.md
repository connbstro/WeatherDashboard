## **Built With:**

## **Process**

- Created a form that searches the weather based on the city.
- Used OpenWeatherAPI to retreive current and future weather data.
- Dynamically created elements that append to the page when the search button is clicked.
- Used localStorage to save previously searched cities and display them as buttons on the page allowing the user to retrieve the weather for cities in their search history.
